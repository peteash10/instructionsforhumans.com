*While talking to people in the gallery I'm sometimes remembering to record my side of the conversation with a lapel mic. This surveillance is intended to augment my terrible memory and is being transcribed / described by Karen Cameron who is on a mission of her own to understand what the hell I'm doing.*

*What follows is excerpts from those trans/descriptions presented out of context. Please dip in and ponder according to your wants and needs.*


This is my brain, I can't settle, The idea of making a thing to look at for three months horrified me. I’d hate it after a week. I'm going for professor's office/lounge/workshop feel. It’s pretty bare at the moment. Later on I'll be working with Emily and Aleks who’ll be responding to this space using gesture. I want to get into that performative area, that feels like a fruitful place to go with this sort of stuff.

I'm trying to be an artificially intelligent system. I want people to tell me stuff, send ideas in, bring things in and, just as a child learning, stuff comes out afterwards. The outputs will be filtered/shaped by the people that come into the gallery. It’s emerging, evolving. It will look completely different in a few weeks time. I don't know how it will look as I haven't been given the instructions yet .

This is a generative art system done by human rather than machine.

Electronic billboards on the high st have cameras on, they are profiling you. It may show you a specific advert based on that profile. You can only guess at what it's doing. I'm interested in these guesses and deductions that ppl come up with.

Man says the camera on a billboard will be the modern equiv of the clockface on a church industrial age, the tallest building in the village, everyone know where they ought to be and when, a movement away from "natural time" towards the idea of the working day. Pete says tech is programmed by society and economy. Science can be neutral but technology is programmed in specific ways. Man talks about a bell in the lake district, he thinks that chimes every hour throughout the night guest houses have said enough is enough. Pete says a tool of control has become a heritage thing.

Man talks about dead streets that are on maps but don't go anywhere. Pete talks about [Andy Howlett](http://andyhowlett.co.uk)'s walk where he followed paths that abruptly stop.
