While talking to people in the gallery I'm trying to remember to record my side of the conversation with a lapel mic. This surveillance is intended to augment my terrible memory and is being transcribed / described by Karen Cameron who is on a mission to understand what the hell I'm doing.

As such the data is being processed through a number of technical and mental systems. What follows is excerpts from those trans/descriptions presented out of context. Please dip in and ponder according to your wants and needs. If you would like to feed back into the work with ideas of your own, please come and visit or get in touch.

This is my brain, I can't settle, The idea of making a thing to look at for three months horrified me. I’d hate it after a week. I'm going for professor's office/lounge/workshop feel. It’s pretty bare at the moment. Later on I'll be working with Emily and Aleks who’ll be responding to this space using gesture. I want to get into that performative area, that feels like a fruitful place to go with this sort of stuff.

I'm trying to be an artificially intelligent system. I want people to tell me stuff, send ideas in, bring things in and, just as a child learning, stuff comes out afterwards. The outputs will be filtered/shaped by the people that come into the gallery. It’s emerging, evolving. It will look completely different in a few weeks time. I don't know how it will look as I haven't been given the instructions yet .

This is a generative art system done by human rather than machine.

Electronic billboards on the high st have cameras on, they are profiling you. It may show you a specific advert based on that profile. You can only guess at what it's doing. I'm interested in these guesses and deductions that ppl come up with.

Man says the camera on a billboard will be the modern equiv of the clockface on a church industrial age, the tallest building in the village, everyone know where they ought to be and when, a movement away from "natural time" towards the idea of the working day. Pete says tech is programmed by society and economy. Science can be neutral but technology is programmed in specific ways. Man talks about a bell in the lake district, he thinks that chimes every hour throughout the night guest houses have said enough is enough. Pete says a tool of control has become a heritage thing.

Man talks about dead streets that are on maps but don't go anywhere. Pete talks about [Andy Howlett](http://andyhowlett.co.uk)'s walk where he followed paths that abruptly stop. 


How do you hold on to and manipulate data? I'll step into the shoes of the processor and see what happens. I'm interested how these machines can change our perception of the world. Is google editing my work? Where is the authorship when google chooses keywords to match photos?

Man asks how do you see this kind of thing evolving. Pete talks about the performance artists. Says he's disillusioned with using photography but is still into cameras. He's thinking about gestures and the relationship between humans and machines. I have no performance art background. Thinking about getting into the city and out of the gallery. How does the city hold itself together, what are the rules and compromises we have in society. Addressing those by behaving in different ways. Pete’s looking to do a collaborative thing.

Man says Pete is making links between the idea of ritual of the citizen and how behaviour is influenced by AI.

SEO fascinates me. It's like praying for rain. Talks about the spotify song skipping myth. Computer systems are rational but so complex as to seem magical. It just works.

Man says there's been a shift from late analogue tech to modern tech encased in a black box. You can't fix/repair tech anymore. Pete says people in china can build and fix iPhones but Apple want to promote the myth of magic. 

Pete talks about machine learning. Simple maths on a massive scale. Data goes in, potentially useful data comes out. Pete uses ants behaviour as an analogy, simple but complex. The main ingredient is processing power.

This is my art, explaining things to people.
