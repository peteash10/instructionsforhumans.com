A Data Detox Surgery was held as part of the Instructions for Humans exhibition on November 18th with guest [Fiona Cullinan](http://fionacullinan.com/) offering advice on protecting your online data.

This was informed by her research and time spent with [Tactical Tech](https://tacticaltech.org)'s [The Glass Room](https://theglassroom.org) a couple of weeks previously. Materials from The Glass Room were on display as talking points. 

We hope, along with the local [Open Rights Group](https://openrightsgroupbirmingham.wordpress.com), to use the Glass Room resources to bring these issues to a public space in Birmingham, such as a library or shopping centre. If you can help us do this, please [get in touch](http://fionacullinan.com/contact/).
