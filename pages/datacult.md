**Data Cult** is a series of performances attempting to make sense of data-driven surveillance technologies and our relationship with them.

In order to understand the intangible networks that surround us, it is sometimes useful to imagine their absence and to explore the space left behind. 

Data Cult exists in a world where the network, its sensors and processors, have suddenly vanished. 

[Alex Wojtulewicz](http://a-w-a.co.uk/) spent the week leading up to the event attempting to process surveillance footage and communicate its content to a camera. He does this through a code built of exercise routines until his body is exhausted. 

[Emily Warner](https://emily-warner.com/) used algorithmically generated icons from the pre-absence era to guide her movements, which she attempted to record using ropes and weights. [Karen Cameron](https://twitter.com/KCanard) annotates the piece in real time creating a feedback loop.

The works were devised with Pete Ashton who will continue to process data collected from them over the duration of the exhibition. 

The framework chosen for this is the [Cargo Cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) phenomena from South Pacific islands, specifically how they emerged in the late 1940s as a response to the sudden disapearance of military supply chains between the US and Japan. 

It's my contention that these cults, being driven by the absence of a techology that had dominated and changed their society, give us a valuable tool for understanding the shape and quality of systems that are otherwise intangiable and opaque. Just as the sudden absence of an air conditioner hum has a tangiable nature, the absence of The Network reveals to us its salient features. 

Data Cult premiered at [BOM](http://www.bom.org.uk) (Birmingham Open Media) on November 6th 2017. Documentation and derived artworks are arvhived on this page.
