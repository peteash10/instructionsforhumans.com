Data Cult is a series of performances taking place within the Instructions for Humans exhibition which attempt to make sense of data-driven surveillance technologies and our relationship with them.

The framework I have chosen for this is the Cargo Cult phenomena from South Pacific islands, specifically how they emerged in the late 1940s as a response to the sudden disapearance of military supply chains between the US and Japan. 

It's my contention that these cults, being driven by the absence of a techology that had dominated and changed their society, give us a valuable tool for understanding the shape and quality of systems that are otherwise intangiable and opaque. Just as the sudden absence of an air conditioner hum has a tangiable nature, the absence of The Network reveals to us its salient features. 

[Data Cult - An Instructional Event for Humans](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/data-cult-an-instructional-event-for-humans-tickets-39044827129) is the first of these performances and features [Emily Warner](https://emily-warner.com/) and [Alex Wojtulewicz](http://a-w-a.co.uk/) with Karen Cameron. The works have been developed alongside and within the exhibition and will be presented to the public on Monday, 6th November from 6-8pm. Attendance is free (subsidised by the Arts Council grant) but space is limited so [please book](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/data-cult-an-instructional-event-for-humans-tickets-39044827129) if you are sure you will attend.
