**November 22nd - 25th is Data and Art week at Instructions for Humans and I've asked Susan Kruse to bring her Walking Apparatuses in for people to borrow.**

These simple devices consist of a pen suspended in a bottle above a piece of paper. As the device moves, the pen marks the paper and over time creates a visual record of its motion.

The end result can be seen as a visualisation of a journey taken and a record of the manner and style of your movement. It is also very pleasing to look at. 

You are invited to borrow up a Walking Apparatus from the BOM gallery during opening hours (Wed-Sat, 12-5) before spending time in the city centre. It can be put in a carrier bag or held in your hand. When you've finished your shopping or whathaveyou, bring it back to BOM where your drawing will be added to the gallery. Once the show is over I'll post your drawing to you. 

We'll have a few devices ready to borrow but if you want to reserve one specially (and promise to turn up and take it!) contact me on 07775 690106 or pete@peteashton.com and I'll put one aside.

Susan is planning a major project next year involving this technology so you'll be helping her with research and development. 

This exercise emerged from Susan taking the "walk in a straight line" instruction card from the gallery and bringing me the pen drawing as evidence of the walk.
