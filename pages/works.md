The Instruction Station takes in data and information from visitors, weights this with the biases of the artist and produces works which are presented as art. Here are some of them. 

# Data Cult

[Data Cult - An Instructional Event for Humans](http://instructionsforhumans.com/datacult/) consisted of two new performances presented to the public on Monday November 6th 2017 by Emily Warner and Alex Wojtulewicz. Documentation of the performances will be treated as artistic material for the creation of further works. 

[Data Cult is being archived in full on this page.](http://instructionsforhumans.com/datacult/)

# Cell Tower Mast For Sympathetic Magic Rituals

A wooden triangle structure with three H shapes on each corner mimicking the antenna of a cell tower mast. 

Inspired by [a photo from Puerto Rico post-hurricane](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2017/09/disconnected-by-disasterphotos-from-a-battered-puerto-rico/540975/#img08) where people are gathered around a cell tower waiting for the signal to come back on. Traditionally folk would gather at the church or town hall for information or solace, but this is now provided by the digital network which is physically manifested by the tower. 

This connected with my interest in the post-WWII [cargo cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) of the South Pacific and the [gestures and rituals](http://curiousrituals.nearfuturelaboratory.com) that have emerged during the Internet age. 

Will be used for a ritual event on Saturday 9th December by [Hipkiss and Graney](https://www.hipkissandgraney.com).

# Transcripts of Humans

Conversations with the artist are recorded because the artist has a terrible memory. These recordings are summarised by the transcriber, [Karen Cameron](https://twitter.com/KCanard). The artist has loosely edited the summaries to remove sensitive information and presented those from the first month on the walls of the gallery. The transcriber continues to summarise conversations, some of which are now about her summaries. This produces [interesting feedback loops](https://amwritingthings.tumblr.com/post/166671665230/systems-in-the-text).

# Data Vacuum From A Cross City Walk

A special [Cross City Walk](http://xcw.org.uk) was undertaken by the artist and [Andy Howlett](http://andyhowlett.co.uk) on Sunday 8th October where they walked in as straight a line as possible across suburban Birmingham from Sarehole Mill to Tiseley Station. The artist picked up any unnatural object that caught his eye and fitted in his hand. These are on display in the gallery.

# The Madness of Crowdfunding

A box on the gallery shelves into which visitors are invited to place an idea for an artwork along with Â£1 to fund it. Towards the end of the exhibition in December the artist will combine all the ideas and all the money and produce a Frankenstein amalgamartwork.

## More to come..

Artworks are created with and in response to people visiting the show. Towards the end of the run I will be specifically inviting artists to work within the space to see what they come up with. To a less formal degree this invitation is open to all. 

**Instructions for Humans** is open at [BOM (Birmingham Open Media)](http://www.bom.org.uk) Wed - Sat, 12 - 5pm until December 13th. [Subscribe to this newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/peteashton) to stay informed of things.
