# A Cargo Cult for AI

Cargo Cult is a term used to describe activities of a religious nature that emerge in late-colonial era when societies that might be considered primitive suddenly come into contact with a society that might be considered technologically advanced. 

As such the term, and the phenomena it describes, is fraught with issues, the least of which is the air of condescension it implies. Look at those idiots who can't comprehend stuff we take for granted. Aren't they hilarious with their made up religions. Aren't we superior with our rational science. 

I quickly realised I needed to avoid this approach to the cargo cult. These are not idiots. They are, if anything, exhibiting a perfectly sensible and rational response to a change in their society, folding the beliefs and behaviours that bond their communities around this change to create a continuity. Or maybe something else. Many academics are exploring these questions.

[Arthur C Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws) famously coined the law "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." This betrays a rather reductive notion of what magic is and the purpose it serves in the real world. Which is a weird sentence to write, so I'd better explain my working concept of magic. 

Magicians are what scientists were before they were scientists. They were, broadly, trying to understand how the world works and how to use that knowledge to shape the world. Magic, therefore, is related to the scientific method of observation and iteration. 

Where it differs is in its subject matter. Science is about the physical world. Magic is about the mental world. Science is about atoms, magic concerns itself with ideas. 

(A problem with exploring magical thinking in this way is the field has been colonised by a load of eejits, but I can recommend [John Higgs' biography of the KLF](http://amzn.to/2BFGwcc) as a good primer.)

My route into thinking about magic came through thinking about how art works. Art, for me, is about changing people's view of the world. When you finish a great novel or come away from an amazing painting, the world seems different to you. The most visceral example of this for me was coming out of a David Lynch film in central London and getting the tube home. My perception had been utterly reprogrammed and everything was terrifying. 

This happens because our knowledge of the world is filtered. First by the limitations of our senses, and then by the limitations of our congition. We cannot be aware of everything that is going on around and still function, so we have to shut out the world and focus on what is important.
