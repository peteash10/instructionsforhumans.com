# Forthcoming Events

## Data and Art

*November 22-25*

How do we make art about data? How can we think of [data as an artistic material](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/LEON_a_01414)? Are we talking about the numbers, or what the numbers represent, or what created the numbers? What is data anyway?

**All Week:** [Kruse's Drawing Apparatuses](http://instructionsforhumans.com/kruse/) will be available for you to borrow and carry around the city as they draw a record of your movement. These generated artworks will be displayed in the gallery and posted to you later. [More details here.](http://instructionsforhumans.com/kruse/) 

**Saturday:** [Data Art Day](http://instructionsforhumans.com/dataartday/) sees me inviting three guests to the gallery to show and talk about their work. At 5pm of the day there'll be semi-formal gathering with beverages aimed at artists working with, or thinking about working with, data and information.

## Data Rituals

*December 6-9*

Tying up my thoughts around [cargo cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) and bringing in stuff from the [Curious Rituals](http://curiousrituals.nearfuturelaboratory.com) and [Networks of New York](http://amzn.to/2tCcPU7) books, along with a chunk of psychogeography-eque strategies for breaking/creating rules of engaging with the world. 

By now we should know what "a Cargo Cult for AI" looks like. I’ll be revisiting the Data Cult performances from November and talking through the ideas that have crystallised through the exhibition. 

**TBA:** [Andy Howlett](http://andyhowlett.co.uk) and myself will lead a psychogeographic walk around Birmingham city centre looking at where the internet leaks out into the infrastructure of the city.

**Saturday:** Local artists [Hipkiss & Graney](https://www.hipkissandgraney.com) will perform a ritual of some description around the wooden cell tower antenna in the gallery. There may be chanting. 

## The End

*December 13-16*

We will have spent 14 weeks art-making and discussing. I’ll be exhausted and looking forward to a rest. 

But before I go, conclusions must be drawn, plans made and instructions given. 

I will have something to say. 

You will need to hear it. 

Watch this space.
