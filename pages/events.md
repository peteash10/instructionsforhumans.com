## Data and Art

*November 22-25*

How do we make art about data? How can we think of [data as an artistic material](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/LEON_a_01414)? Are we talking about the numbers, or what the numbers represent, or what created the numbers? What is data anyway?

**All Week:** [Kruse's Drawing Apparatuses](http://instructionsforhumans.com/kruse/) were be available for you to borrow and carry around the city to draw a record of your movement. These generated artworks are be displayed in the gallery. [More details here.](http://instructionsforhumans.com/kruse/) 

**Saturday:** [Data Art Day](http://instructionsforhumans.com/dataartday/) saw me inviting three guests to the gallery to show and talk about their work. At 5pm there was a semi-formal gathering with beverages aimed at artists working with, or thinking about working with, data and information.
