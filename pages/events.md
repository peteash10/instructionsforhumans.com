Events for Humans

A significant outcome of Instructions for Humans will be two new performance works developed with artists [Emily Warner](http://emily-warner.com) and [Aleks Wojtulewicz](http://hfwas.co.uk/?page_id=27) to premier in November.

- Emily will attempt to materialise the data streams through movement and gesture, building a feedback loop between her body and the system.
- Aleks will have his muscles connected to electrodes controlled by the artificial intelligence system turning him into a literal meat-puppet. 

From November through to Christmas there will be evening and weekend workshops and excursions exploring the digital and physical systems of the city and developing tactics for living within them, from surveillance to data security to the psychology of city planning. These "data survival" events will look at work from artists, academics, activists and privacy campaigners and involve experts in these fields. 

There will also be workshops and talks looking at practical uses of Machine Learning technology with an emphasis on [artistic production](http://ml4a.github.io).
