## November 1-4

**Data Cult: Capture Marathon**

[Aleks Wojtulewicz](http://a-w-a.co.uk) will be undertaking a data-generating durational performance piece during gallery opening hours prior to its formal presentation on Monday 6th. Please treat him as you would any other sculpture.

## Monday November 6

**Data Cult: An Instructional Event For Humans**

[Emily Warner](https://emily-warner.com) and [Aleks Wojtulewicz](http://a-w-a.co.uk) will be performing new works devised with Pete Ashton as part of Instructions for Humans. The works will be developed during October - more details will be announced as they are worked out!

The performances will be free to attend but booking will be essential.

## November 9-11 / 15-18

[QTOPIA](http://www.bom.org.uk/event/qtopia/) by [Leo Francisco](http://queerzone3000.net/) will be installed at BOM for the [SHOUT festival](http://www.shoutfestival.co.uk/whats-on/all-shows/shout-17-qtopia-leo-francisco/). While distinct from Instructions for Humans it shares similar themes and we have plans to bleed the two shows together somehow. 

## Sunday November 19th

I will be speaking at the [Random String](http://randomstring.co) mini-conference at [Warwick Arts Centre](https://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk) about Instructions for Humans with an emphasis on the performances with Emily and Aleks. 

# The Final Five

The last five weeks of the show will be themed around issues that have emerged during conversations and actives in the gallery. Each week will culminate with an event of some description during the Saturday afternoon. 

The very final week will wrap everything up in a nice tidy box, put a ribbon on it, and bid us bon voyage into the unknown future. 

*Details will be announced once they are known and are* ***massively subject to change.*** 

## Week 1

*November 15-18*

### Data Detox

![](http://instructionsforhumans.com/images/datadetox.jpg)

Privacy, data security, what is it, should we worry about it? Is it possible to fight against the excesses of [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism) or is it just as effective to bury one's head in the sand? 

**All Week:** Crossing over with [QTOPIA](http://www.bom.org.uk/event/qtopia/) in the adjoining room, I'll be showcasing some artistic and creative strategies for obsfucating your personal activity from The Network and trying a few things out on myself. 

**Saturday:** [Fiona Cullinan](http://fionacullinan.com/projects/infosecurity/), just back from [The Glass Room](https://theglassroom.org) show in London, will be running a free drop-in Data Detox surgery in the gallery from 1-3pm to answer your questions and point you in the right direction. [More details here.](http://www.bom.org.uk/event/data-detox-surgery/) 

## Week 2

*November 22-25*

### Data and Art

![](http://instructionsforhumans.com/images/kruse1-1.jpg)


How do we make art about data? How can we think of [data as an artistic material](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/LEON_a_01414)? Are we talking about the numbers, or what the numbers represent, or what created the numbers? What is data anyway? 

**All Week:** [Susan Kruse's Drawing Apparatuses](http://instructionsforhumans.com/kruse/) will be available for you to borrow and carry around the city as they draw a record of your movement. These generated artworks will be displayed in the gallery and posted to you later. [More details here.](http://instructionsforhumans.com/kruse/) 

**Saturday:** I'll be inviting three data artists to be in the gallery with me to show and talk about their work. At the end of the day there'll be an informal talk/seminar/discussion with beverages aimed at artists working with, or thinking about working with, data and information. 

## Week 3

*Nov 29 - Dec 2nd*

Probably on the politics of it all. Kate Crawford's talk [Dark Days: AI and the Rise of Fascism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlr4O1aEJvI) focussed a lot of issues me. What can we take from that? What is the political strategy for addressing these massive shifts that inform the fabric of society? What can we do on a local level to make a difference? Culminating in a panel or group discussion with interested parties or maybe a workshop.

## Week 4

*December 6-9*

Something about rituals. Tying up my thoughts around [cargo cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) and bringing in stuff from the [Curious Rituals](http://curiousrituals.nearfuturelaboratory.com) and [Networks of New York](http://amzn.to/2tCcPU7) books along with a chunk of psychogeography-eque strategies for breaking/creating rules of engaging with the world. [Andy Howlett](http://andyhowlett.co.uk) will be involved and there will be explorations of the city. Hopefully I'll get [Hipkiss and Graney](https://www.hipkissandgraney.com) on board to do a ritual for the [wooden cell tower](http://instructionsforhumans.com/works/) I've built.

## Week 5

*December 13-16*

Where do we go from here? What have we learned? What can we do? What should we do? 

The gallery goes retro/futrospective in an attempt to make it all worthwhile. Culminates in a gathering of some kind.
