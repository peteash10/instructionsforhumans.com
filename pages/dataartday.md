**Saturday 25th November saw three guests joining me in the BOM gallery to share their work and ideas about using data in art.** 

This event was not about computers or programming. It was about the practice of using information in all art forms. I was particularly interested in those who do not consider themselves "digital" attending. 

- **2-5pm:** Guests from a range of art backgrounds were in the gallery talking about their work and the work that inspires them. 
- **5-7pm:** A semi-formal gathering with snacks and drinks in the basement for artists and practitioners who use information in their work.

## What is Data Art?

Data Art is often confused with [Dataviz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization), which while interesting and perfectly valid, is a completely different approach. 

Data Art can usefully be defined as using data, or information, as a material which can be shaped and formed as a sculptor might shape and form clay. 

The artist has to respect the material they are using, understand its strengths and behaviour, but is not beholden to its meaning. 

Data Art uses information to tell a new story about the world, not simply record what has happened. It treats photos not as documentation but as raw material for new adventures. 

To help me tease this idea into something coherent, I will be joined by three guests. From left to right...

**[Hannah Redler Hawes](https://theodi.org/team/hannah-redler)** is an independent curator representing [Data as Culture](https://theodi.org/culture), the art programme for the Open Data Institute. She was previously Head of Arts Programme at the London Science Museum. 

**[Nikki Pugh](http://npugh.co.uk/)** is an artist whose work is centred around interactions between people and place: often using tools and strategies from areas such as pervasive games and physical computing to set up frameworks for exploration. Her work *Colony* uses GPS data as an art material and she brought *Orrery for Landscape, Sinew and Serendipity* to the gallery. 

**Kruse** is an artist whose [Drawing Apparatus](http://instructionsforhumans.com/kruse/) were available to borrow during the week. Her practice is primarily concerned with drawing and has included video, sound, sculpture and performance. She is currently developing a new body of work that explores the role of information and data in autistic experience and culture, using lo-fi and digital drawing methods. 

**Pete Ashton** is myself and I was specifically talking about [Data Cult](http://instructionsforhumans.com/datacult/) where I worked with two performance artists to make work about data tracking technology.

(My interest in data as an art material first crystallised at a talk by [Julie Freeman](http://www.translatingnature.org) and her co-authored paper [A Concise Taxonomy for Describing Data as an Art Material](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283053670_A_Concise_Taxonomy_for_Describing_Data_as_an_Art_Material). Thanks Julie!)
