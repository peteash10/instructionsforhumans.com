**Saturday 25th November saw three guests joining me in the BOM gallery to share their work and ideas about using data in art.** 

This event was not about computers or programming. It was about the practice of using information in all art forms. I was particularly interested in those who do not consider themselves "digital" attending. 

- **2-5pm:** Guests from a range of art backgrounds were in the gallery talking about their work and the work that inspires them. 
- **5-7pm:** A semi-formal gathering with snacks and drinks in the basement for artists and practitioners who use information in their work.

## What is Data Art?

**Data Art** is distinct from [Dataviz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization), which is a completely different approach.

**Data Art** does not have to use computers or code. It is made with information that is recorded over time.

**Data Art** uses information as a material which can be shaped and formed as a sculptor might shape and form clay.

**Data Art** sees the artist respect the material they are using, understanding its strengths and behaviour, but not beholden to its meaning.

**Data Art** uses information to tell a new story about the world, not simply record what has happened. 

**Data Art** treats photos not as documentation but as raw material for new adventures.

To help me tease this idea into something coherent, I was joined by three guests. From left to right...

**[Hannah Redler Hawes](https://theodi.org/team/hannah-redler)** is an independent curator representing [Data as Culture](https://theodi.org/culture), the art programme for the Open Data Institute. She was previously Head of Arts Programme at the London Science Museum. 

**[Nikki Pugh](http://npugh.co.uk/)** is an artist whose work is centred around interactions between people and place: often using tools and strategies from areas such as pervasive games and physical computing to set up frameworks for exploration. Her work *Colony* uses GPS data as an art material and she brought *Orrery for Landscape, Sinew and Serendipity* to the gallery. 

**Kruse** is an artist whose [Drawing Apparatus](http://instructionsforhumans.com/kruse/) were available to borrow during the week. Her practice is primarily concerned with drawing and has included video, sound, sculpture and performance. She is currently developing a new body of work that explores the role of information and data in autistic experience and culture, using lo-fi and digital drawing methods. 

**Pete Ashton** is myself and I brielfy framed the talks using [Data Cult](http://instructionsforhumans.com/datacult/) where I worked with two performance artists to make work about data tracking technology.

(My interest in data as an art material first crystallised at a talk by [Julie Freeman](http://www.translatingnature.org) and her co-authored paper [A Concise Taxonomy for Describing Data as an Art Material](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283053670_A_Concise_Taxonomy_for_Describing_Data_as_an_Art_Material). Thanks Julie!)
