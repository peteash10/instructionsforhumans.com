# Instructions for Humans - A Cargo Cult for Artificial Intelligence

A major new work exploring human interactions with machine learning, centred around an exhibition at [Birmingham Open Media](http://bom.org.uk) from September to December 2017. Funded by [Arts Council England](http://artscouncil.org.uk/), the work will be available for touring from 2018. 


# Project Summary

*(Subject to change as the work is developed up to the launch on September 12th 2017)*

**Instructions for Humans** uses recent developments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tools to explore the systems that guide society and our relationship to them. The work will address the following issues:

- How machine gesture informs the human creative process and in turn how human gesture might inform mechanical representations.
- What it means for a computer to "see".
- How society can be influenced by opinions derived from the perceptions of machines.
- How interrogating mechanical systems can help us to question the biases of our own sense-based cognition.

Produced during the shockwaves of Brexit and Trump, upsets thought to be informed by algorithmic distribution of "fake news" and data-mining, the work will address concepts of filters, truth, objectivity and the fungibility of facts, exploring tactics to understand and deal with this media environment as it relates to the culture and society of Birmingham, UK. 

The work will balance serious themes with an explorative and educational approach, encouraging audiences to think about these processes and systems in modern society in an era of massive data processing by governments and corporations, to reveal the man behind the curtain but also address the confused fear and despair that often surrounds these issues.
